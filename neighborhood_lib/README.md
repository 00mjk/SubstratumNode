# neighborhood_lib
Route generation for SubstratumNode

## Purpose
The purpose of `neighborhood_lib` is to generate Routes for CORES packages that originate from its own SubstratumNode.
It does this by cultivating a sparse map of other SubstratumNodes in the SubstratumNetwork.

It is built as a library, and is not intended as a standalone program.
It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/SubstratumNetwork/substratum_node_plex/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
