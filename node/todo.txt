Caution! Be aware that disabling systemd-resolvd might break name resolution in VPN for some users. See this bug on launchpad (Thanks, Vincent).

Disable the systemd-resolved service and stop it:

    sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
    sudo service systemd-resolved stop

Put the following line in the [main] section of your /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf:

    dns=default

Delete the symlink /etc/resolv.conf

    rm /etc/resolv.conf

Restart network-manager

    sudo service network-manager restart
