# logger_trait_lib
Utility library for logging

## Purpose
The purpose of `logger_trait_lib` is a logging utility library shared among other modules.

It is built as a library, and is not intended as a standalone program.
It probably isn't the most interesting place to begin digging into our code;
[node](https://github.com/SubstratumNetwork/SubstratumNode/tree/master/node)
is a better place to start.
