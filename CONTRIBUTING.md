# Contributing to the Substratum Network

## Introduction

:tada: First off, thank you for your interest in contributing! :tada:

At this time, the development team of Substratum is preparing for your support to the Substratum Network. 
This means determining the best way that they can handle issues and pull requests, keep private and public 
repositories in sync, and a host of other things to make this project accessible and the team responsive to 
the needs of the community.

Until this contributor's guide is filled in with more details on how to contribute, feel free to download the 
source or even simply walk through the code via Github. If you choose to go further, get familiar with the Rust 
language. Explore setting up the Substratum development environment and building the software.
